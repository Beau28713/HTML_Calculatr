# HTML_Calculatr
Simple Calculator written in HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. 
This is my first project while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All scripts and styles are imbedded
into the html code file. 
This calc only does simple addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. I may add more complex 
options later on as I learn.
